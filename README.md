#Fit Journal

An application to help you keep track of your food intake, as well as the exercise that you do.

##What it does

  - Logs your Kilojoule and Protein intake of each meal
  - Logs the Kilojoules burnt for each workout
  - Gives you the amount of Kilojoules you burnt (or didn't) during a day, week, month, etc
  - Gives you the total protein intake of each day, week, month, etc

##What it DOESN'T do (yet... these are TODOS)

  - Keep a catalog of previously added meals (and workouts) so you don't have to add
    the specific Kilojoule and Protein information each time
  - Provide a Kilojoule calculator that lets you put in the type of exercise, the duration,
    and some other information and have it determine the Kj burnt for you
  - Delete existing meals or workouts (entries)
  - Any sort of user authorization

##Technical TODOs

  - Use Angular for the frontend
  - Deploy it to Heroku
  - Use EJBs for the backend (using an embedded EJB Container)
